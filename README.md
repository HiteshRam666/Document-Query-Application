## System Architecture and Design

The Document Query Application is designed with a modular architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability. The system is divided into the following components:

1. **Frontend (Streamlit App)**:
    - Provides an interactive web interface for users to upload documents, enter queries, and view results.
    - Handles user authentication, document uploads, and query processing.

2. **Backend (Data Processing and Storage)**:
    - **Document Processing**: Extracts text from uploaded PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
    - **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizes and removes stop words from the text.
    - **Query Processing**: Uses BERT embeddings to encode and compare queries with document content.
    - **Database Management**: Stores user queries and responses securely.

3. **Security**:
    - **Encryption**: Uses Fernet encryption to securely store user queries and responses.
    - **Data Integrity**: Handles errors related to data decryption and encryption.

4. **Dependencies**:
    - Utilizes libraries like PyPDF2, python-docx, NLTK, and transformers for text processing and analysis.

## Database Schema

The application uses an SQLite database to store user history. The schema is defined as follows:

### `user_history` Table

| Column    | Type    | Description                           |
|-----------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| `user_id` | TEXT    | Unique identifier for the user.        |
| `query`   | TEXT    | Encrypted query text submitted by the user. |
| `response`| TEXT    | Encrypted response text from the documents. |
| `timestamp` | DATETIME | Timestamp of when the query was made.   |

**SQL Statement to Create Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_history (
    user_id TEXT,
    query TEXT,
    response TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Instructions for Adding New Documents

1. **File Upload**:
    - Navigate to the sidebar on the Streamlit app and click on "Upload Documents".
    - Select and upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files. Multiple files can be uploaded at once.

2. **Processing**:
    - Uploaded files are processed to extract text.
    - The extracted text is then preprocessed (tokenized, stop words removed) for better search results.

3. **Querying**:
    - After uploading documents, enter a query in the provided input field and click "Search".
    - The app will process the query and compare it against the uploaded documents using BERT embeddings.

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **Data Encryption**:
    - User queries and responses are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm.
    - Encryption key is stored securely and must be consistent across sessions.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - The application includes error handling for encryption and decryption failures.
    - Users are notified if data decryption fails due to key mismatch or data corruption.

3. **Data Integrity**:
    - The application ensures that encrypted data is correctly handled and stored.
    - Attempts to decrypt data are managed to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **File Handling**:
    - Uploaded files are processed and stored temporarily to avoid data leakage.
    - Secure practices are followed in handling and processing user files.

## Installation

To set up the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-query-app.git
    cd document-query-app
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the App**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Upload Documents**:
    - Use the sidebar to upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.

3. **Search Documents**:
    - Enter your query in the text input field and click "Search" to find the most relevant document content.

4. **View and Download History**:
    - Click "Download Chat History" to download your past queries and responses.
